It is one of the largest zoos in the United States by area, comprising 265 acres of park lands and naturalistic habitats separated by the Bronx River. On average, the zoo has 2.15 million visitors each year as of 2009. But occasionally, it can be overcrowded.\n\n\"Nice zoo but overcrowded with humans instead of animals.\nZoo is conveniently located close to the westfarm subway station (Line 2 or 5). Plenty of shops/ice-cream vendors/marketplace near the zoo and hence plenty of choice for food before entering the zoo. Inside zoo the Bengal monorail ride was nice and thrilling with great sights. However animals were not much in sight esp lions and tigers. Peacocks/peafowls were nice and photogenic. On wednesdays the place is overcrowded and perhaps why we felt it was too crowded. 4D show was nice and so was the Walking Trail\" Quoted by Laks V.\n",
